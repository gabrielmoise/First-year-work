// A class of objects to represent a set
/**
DESIGN DECISIONS:
1. I used a dummy header node to not bother with the special case when we remove the first node
2. My linked list doesn't have repetitions, because a mathematical set does not allow repetitions (it's not a bag)
3. I store the elements in increasing order to be able to check if two sets are equal by applying toString to both and checking for equality
between the strings.
4. For the functions size and sum I kept track of the number of elements after each function (at add and remove we update them)
Also, I created a function that transforms an increasingly-ordered list into an IntSet (so we maintain the increasing order of the data)
